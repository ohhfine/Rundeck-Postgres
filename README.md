this will spin up a postgres container, create a rundeck database and user
and once it is up it will create a rundeck container, all data is persisted
in the directory where the compose file is

was just a little lesson for me in docker-compose on a saturday when it was 
too hot to go outside, i might add a .env file and make it customizable without
having to edit the main compose file, have fun!
